# Claude OAuth DirectSDK

Experimental bundled Hermes provider: `claude-oauth-directsdk`, displayed as **Claude OAuth DirectSDK**. It uses the unmodified official Claude Code executable as a request-scoped model client. Hermes retains its normal agent loop and tool executor. Despite the name, this implementation speaks native stream-json directly and does not require the Python Agent SDK package.

## Status

A real subscription-backed Hermes task built and tested a CSV auditor. Separate live qualifications exercised streaming tool rounds, restart/resume, host-side denial, authentic steering, cancellation during generation, and a real CLI subagent completion. This is a review build, not a full-parity or production-readiness claim. See the remaining limitations below.

Requires Python 3.10+, POSIX, and a separately installed official Claude Code CLI. Native **2.1.263** is qualified. Replay acknowledgments and extra-body behavior are version-sensitive interfaces, not a public arbitrary-history SDK guarantee. This review PR includes both the provider and its generic host support; no external plugin installation is needed.

## Login and select

```sh
claude auth login
hermes --provider claude-oauth-directsdk -m sonnet
```

For a saved selection, run `hermes model`, choose **Claude OAuth DirectSDK**, then
choose a model. The TUI `/model` dialog and Desktop model picker use the same
provider inventory; select the **Claude OAuth DirectSDK** row, not **Anthropic**
or an ACP provider. The catalog includes the CLI aliases `sonnet`, `opus`, and
`haiku`, plus Claude Fable 5.1 (`claude-fable-5-1`). Model availability still
depends on the official CLI and your account; catalog presence is not live
entitlement verification.

The executable must be discoverable for the provider's models to appear. Desktop's
configured-only view keeps this provider once selected with `hermes model` (or
the persistent configuration below); Hermes does not inspect the Claude CLI's
credentials to infer a sign-in. For an explicit session-only switch, use:

```text
/model claude-fable-5-1 --provider claude-oauth-directsdk --session
```

The picker preserves `claude-oauth-directsdk` and its `process://` backend marker.
It does not route these choices through Anthropic's API or the ACP adapter.

Authentication belongs to the official CLI. The plugin never opens, copies, refreshes, or prints its credential files. No Hermes API key is required or sent by the plugin. The normal Hermes client path rejects inherited API-key, custom Anthropic endpoint, and cloud-backend overrides before spawning; the error names conflicting environment variables without printing their values. Remove those overrides from the launching environment when selecting OAuth. There is no silent HTTP/API-key fallback in this client.

Subscription entitlement and extra-usage settings still belong to the account and native service. Disable extra usage in the account if you do not want overage billing. A native list-price cost estimate is not proof of a subscription charge.

For a separately CLI-managed auth directory:

```sh
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/official-cli-config claude auth login
export CLAUDE_OAUTH_DIRECTSDK_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/official-cli-config
```

An inherited `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` also works. To select an executable outside PATH, set `CLAUDE_OAUTH_DIRECTSDK_COMMAND` to its absolute path. There is no unrestricted public CLI-flags setting; isolation and denial flags are plugin-owned. The low-level Python `Client(env=...)` injection is available for explicitly controlled local fixtures and does not apply the inherited-environment guard. It is not the normal Hermes provider path or an OAuth certification mechanism.

Persistent configuration:

```yaml
model:
  provider: claude-oauth-directsdk
  default: sonnet
```

Auxiliary/fallback routing remains owned by Hermes. Configure those routes explicitly if they must also use the subscription; this provider does not silently change other selected providers.

## Ownership and replay

Each `chat.completions.create` starts a fresh process in a private temporary directory. Native tools, skills and setting sources are disabled. MCP advertises only the current Hermes tool inventory, has inert callbacks, and is denied execution by native `dontAsk`. Full descriptions and schemas are supplied through tools plus validated generation fields in `CLAUDE_CODE_EXTRA_BODY`; authentication and identity fields are never replaced.

Canonical history is replayed in order. Historical user frames use `shouldQuery:false`, each with a zero-turn acknowledgment; the final user/tool-result frame queries. There is no parked native session, synthetic continue prompt, or native approval wait. Native date/budget reminders and cache annotations remain present, so the wire prompt is not byte-identical Hermes-only context.

Text streams incrementally. A complete tool batch is published only after assistant completion, `message_stop`, final usage and native exit. Hermes then applies its own hooks, approvals, tools and persistence. Tool names map through `mcp__hermes__`; original names must be unique ASCII alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen identifiers of at most 50 characters.

`--max-turns 1` is a logical native step, not a guarantee of one HTTP request under native retries. `error_max_turns` is accepted only with a complete tool batch, usage and exit code 1. Native `num_turns` may be 2 at that boundary. Other failures remain failures.

A versioned `reasoning_details` envelope retains ordered native assistant messages and signed thinking. Hermes' surrounding-whitespace normalization is accepted without changing native blocks. Semantic text/tool edits are rejected rather than silently replaying stale native history. Arbitrary compaction or output-hook rewrites of a retained signed assistant are not yet supported; ordinary unchanged-history restart/resume passed.

This provider opts into delivering actual queued steering as a canonical user message after the tool batch. It does not parse tool text to manufacture user authority. Other providers retain their existing steering behavior. Natural change-of-plan steering passed in the real loop; an exact synthetic acknowledgment instruction was still rejected even with correct user-role delivery. Transport fidelity cannot guarantee model obedience.

## Lifecycle and request support

Outside an event loop, `create` is synchronous; inside an event loop, it returns an offloaded coroutine. Streams also support `async for`. One client should belong to one independently cancellable Hermes owner.

`cancel()` signals owned POSIX process groups without closing another thread's active descriptors. `close()` prevents new calls and finalizes idle/unstarted streams; active consumers unwind after cancellation. Early stream exit requires `close()` / `aclose()`. Live interruption stopped generation and the observed native PID exited.

Supported translation includes text, base64/native images and documents, canonical tools/results, output-token limits, stop sequences, sampling fields, reasoning enable/disable and effort, and JSON-schema response-format projection. Model/service restrictions still apply; the tested native Sonnet rejects `temperature` as deprecated. Consequently Hermes' auxiliary title generation currently fails when its caller supplies a fixed temperature and falls back rather than providing a model-generated title. Structured-output projection is not a claim that this caller incompatibility is solved.

Unknown parameters fail explicitly. Unsupported surfaces include assistant prefill, strict function mode, forced tool choice, `parallel_tool_calls=False`, `n>1`, JSON-object-only mode, arbitrary headers/body fields, remote image downloads, non-POSIX cleanup, and cross-model signed-history parity. Extra-body data at or above 120,000 UTF-8 bytes fails rather than truncating. Timeout defaults to 180 seconds and accepts Hermes' finite HTTPX read-timeout shape. Large prompts remain subject to native/OS limits.

Token usage retains native uncached/cache-read/cache-write/output components. Monetary accounting is **not complete**: the live Hermes result currently reports `cost_status: unknown`, so do not rely on dollar-budget enforcement for this route. Interrupted requests without final usage must not be interpreted as free or zero-token service work. Iteration-cap enforcement was observed in the real task.

## Verification

```sh
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/providers/test_claude_oauth_directsdk.py
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/tui_gateway/test_directsdk_picker.py
```

Two consolidated invariant tests cover signed replay and harmless normalization, semantic-edit rejection, final tool batches/usage, async use, lazy failure, invalid parameters, conflicting auth, and active/paused/unstarted stream cleanup. A separate real-native loopback qualification passed parallel tools, full long descriptions/schemas, signed ordering, host-only results, exact usage, incremental streaming and native exit checks. Its responses are synthetic protocol fixtures, not paid-model evidence.

The subscription-backed task, CLI delegation, streaming, resume, denial, steering and interruption receipts are separate private artifacts. No auth data or trajectories are committed to this repository. Remaining review work includes auxiliary sampling compatibility, monetary accounting, semantic-history transformation/compaction, broader version/platform qualification and adversarial steering reliability.
