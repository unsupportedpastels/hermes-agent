"""Lazy re-seed must consume the pending-thinking latch (bug2, 19s blank).

Companion to the continuation-thinking *sync-tick* tests (which cover the
stream-OPEN zombie-handle path).  This one covers the stream-CLOSED path:

A mid-turn boundary (clarify / proactive rotation) closes the native stream
(``_native_stream_opened=False``, awaiting reopen).  A continuation
``llm.request_started`` that arrives while the stream is closed cannot arm the
timer — ``on_llm_thinking`` latches it (``_pending_thinking=True``,
``tool_timer.py:186-189``) for a later reopen to honour.

The initial seed (``stream_consumer.py:1414``) and the eager clarify re-seed
(``:1614``) both call ``_consume_pending_thinking()`` right after opening the
bubble.  The LAZY re-seed (``:3356``, the fallback that reopens on the first
frame after a boundary) sets ``_native_stream_opened=True`` but — before the
fix — does NOT consume the latch.  So a latch honoured only by content arrival
(``_append_accumulated`` clears it at ``:661``) is orphaned when the reopen is
driven by a non-content overlay frame: the ``💭 Thinking`` animation never
appears during the gap (in production, ~19s of dead typing).

Real chain exercised (no simplified mocks): a real ``run()`` seed, the real
``close_for_approval_prompt(reopen=True)`` boundary, the real
``TurnRunner.progress_callback('llm.request_started', …)`` →
``on_llm_thinking`` latch, and a real ``on_tool_progress`` overlay frame that
drives the run loop into the lazy re-seed at ``_send_or_edit`` (``:3356``).

Currently RED: after the overlay reopens the stream, ``_pending_thinking`` is
still True and ``_thinking`` is never armed, because the lazy re-seed skips
``_consume_pending_thinking()``.
