"""Behavior-contract tests for the WeCom native-streaming "重复气泡" fix.

Two production bug classes are covered, each toggle-validated so the test
reproduces the duplicate/mis-decline when the fix is disabled and passes when
it is enabled — proving the assertions track behavior, not a frozen snapshot.

Fix A — Layer 2 must NOT decline/rotate a finalize frame while Layer 1
keep-alive is enabled.  Keep-alive keeps the bubble live, so a large
``stream_age`` is trusted and the finalize lands natively on the SAME stream;
with keep-alive OFF the stream is instead ROTATED near the 10-min wall (old
bubble sealed with finish=true, a fresh stream_id opened on the same req_id,
finalize landed on the new bubble) so the answer is never dropped.  Toggle =
``adapter._stream_keepalive_enabled``.

Fix B — an intermediate frame (finalize=False) failing/expiring must be
fire-and-forget (return True, turn stays live, no consumer fallback), because a
later cumulative frame overwrites it.  Only a FINAL frame (finalize=True)
failure means the screen is genuinely missing content and must return False to
trip the consumer's send() fallback.  Toggle = the ``finalize`` argument.

These drive the REAL ``WeComAdapter._send_stream_frame_inner`` with only the
byte-level ``_send_stream_reply`` seam faked, so the actual finalize / except
control flow runs.  Assertions read observable adapter state: the return value
(what the consumer keys its fallback on), whether the turn survived in
``_stream_turns``, whether the chat was marked expired, and how many finalize
frames actually reached ``_send_stream_reply``.
