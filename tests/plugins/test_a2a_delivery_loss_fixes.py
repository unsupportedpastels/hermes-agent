"""A2A delivery-loss regression coverage: eight focused scenarios.

Covers:
1. Regression: two in-process adapters, A→B with a 2s client timeout while B's
   handler sleeps 10s — B's reply must reach A's session via push, exactly once.
2. Round-trip: a push whose peer answers inside the HTTP response re-enters the
   pushing session; the peer must NOT also push it out-of-band.
3. Patience: a reply resolving after patience+margin takes the push path and
   skips the socket write.
4. Probe race: EOF after a successful write is NOT a rescue — the post-write
   re-probe is gone; a clean close-after-read and a dead-before-read are the
   same MSG_PEEK signal, so nothing pushes after a successful write.
5. Sender stamping: _send_task with no live adapter still stamps
   {agentId, name, url, timeout}; the recipient refines to the real peer.
6. Self-loop guard: unresolvable loopback + unmarked reply → audit
   push_dropped, success=False.
7. Inbound dedupe: the same wire message (contextId, messageId)
   inside _INBOUND_DEDUPE_WINDOW is dropped — _prepare_task rejects it
   without dispatching — accepted again once outside the window, and the
   seen map stays bounded at _INBOUND_DEDUPE_MAX.
8. Rescue flag: the _push_reply_after_client_gone rescue pushes with
   want_reply=True so the peer's answer round-trips; failed
   tasks push nothing.
